# # Import data
# 
# The data contains three years (2015-2017) worth of customer orders, including the following four columns:
# - index
# - customer_email
# - net_revenue
# - year

# In[2]:


orders_df = pd.read_csv ('data/casestudy.csv', header=0, names=['index', 'customer_email', 'net_revenue', 'year'])

# Check if customer emails are unique per year
orders_df.groupby('year')['customer_email'].agg(['size', 'count']) 

# Since the number of rows ('size') equals the number of unique 'customer_email' values (count) for each year, 
# customer emails are unique per year


# # Data analysis
# For each year, the following will be calulated:
# - Total revenue for the current year (existing customer revenue + new customer revenue)
# - New customer revenue (new customers are customers that were not present in previous year only).
# - Existing customer growth (revenue of existing customers for current year â€“ revenue of existing customers from the previous year).
# - Average revenue lost from attrition. Here we assume that the net revenue per lost customer is equal to the average net revenue of the current year.
# - Existing customer revenue current year.
# - Existing customer revenue prior year.
# - Total customers current year.
# - Total customers previous year.
# - New customers.
# - Lost customers.

# # Key findings
# According to the results and plots, the total revenue was the lowest in 2016 (\~\\$27.5M), and highest in 2017 (\~\\$31.4M). The drop in revenue from 2015 to 2016, followed by a rise in revenue from 2016 to 2017, reflects the decrease and increase of customers for those years. The negative existing customer revenue growth in 2016 and 2017 indicates that existing customers decreased their spending or left. Although 2017 experienced a negative existing customer revenue growth, the total revenue increased from 2016 to 2017 due to the new customer spending behavior.
